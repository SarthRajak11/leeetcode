                    LeetCode LLC, doing business as LeetCode, is an online platform for coding interview preparation.
                    The
                    platform provides coding and algorithmic problems intended for users to practice coding.[1] LeetCode
                    has
                    gained popularity among job seekers in the software industry and coding enthusiasts as a resource
                    for
                    technical interviews and coding competitions.[1][2][3][4][5] Features LeetCode offers both free and
                    premium access options. While free users have access to a limited number of questions, premium users
                    gain access to additional questions previously used in interviews at large tech companies.[1] The
                    performance of users' solutions is evaluated based on execution speed and memory usage, and is
                    ranked
                    against other submissions in the LeetCode database.[6] Additionally, LeetCode provides its users
                    with
                    mock interviews and online assessments. LeetCode hosts weekly and biweekly contests, each having 4
                    problems.[4][7] After participating in a contest for the first time, one gets assigned a ranking,
                    which
                    can be found in their profile.[8] LeetCode also provides its users with daily challenges, following
                    UTC,
                    with a lucky draw at the end of each month for those who stayed consistent for the month.[9]
                    LeetCode
                    supports a wide range of programming languages, including Java, Python, JavaScript, and C.[10] In
                    September 2024, LeetCode China supports Huawei's Cangjie programming language [zh] for all
                    problems.[11]
                    The platform features forums where users can engage in discussions related to problems, the
                    interview
                    process, and share their interview experiences.[4] Types of problems Every question on LeetCode has
                    a
                    particular category or tag. Some of the most common tags include arrays, strings, two pointers,
                    stacks,
                    binary search, sliding windows, linked lists, trees, tries, backtracking, heaps, priority queues,
                    graphs, breadth-first search, depth-first search, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, bit
                    manipulation, database problems, and math.[12][better source needed] As of April 2025, LeetCode
                    offers
                    3525 questions across its three levels of difficulty; with 873 questions categorized as easy, 1829
                    as
                    medium, and 823 as hard.[7][better source needed] History LeetCode was founded in Silicon Valley in
                    2015
                    by Winston Tang.[13][14] After moving to the US from Malaysia in 2005, Tang founded the company,
                    citing
                    his own experiences working at Amazon and Google as inspiration.[15][14] LeetCode expanded its
                    operations to China in 2018, providing Chinese problems, solutions and forums in leetcode.cn
                    (Chinese:
                    力扣; pinyin: Lìkòu).[16] In 2021, LeetCode secured its first round of funding, receiving a $10
                    million
                    investment from Lightspeed China Partners.
